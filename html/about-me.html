  <div class="me"> 
    I graduated in 2020 with a degree in Economics and a minor in Studio Art,with hopes of becoming a financial analayst.
    Woefully, the pandemic altered that aspiration and I started my career in operations as an Area Manager at a robotics center. 
    Here, I acquired skills in data analytics and enjoyed it so much, I transitioned into a role that focused only on all things data.
    It didn't take very long for me to grasp its mundaneness and how much it wasn't for me.

  <div class="me">
    I fancied tech, was eager to make the transition, but was clueless on what was available.
    Through research and trials,I landed at Software Development. For the flexibility, creativity, the challenge and the beauty of seeing designs come alive.

  <div class="me"> 
    When I am not working or have my developer hat on I enjoy travelling, cooking and being with my loved ones!
